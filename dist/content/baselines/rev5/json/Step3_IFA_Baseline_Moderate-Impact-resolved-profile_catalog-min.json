Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see [CA-3](#ca-3) ). Transferring information between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information owners\/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only), verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or privacy attributes and labels.\n\nOrganizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and\/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and\/or inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-domain solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf products. Information flow enforcement also applies to control plane traffic (e.g., routing and DNS)."},{"id":"ac-4_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-04","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"approved authorizations are enforced for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on {{ insert: param, ac-04_odp }}."},{"id":"ac-4_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-04-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Access control policy\n\ninformation flow control policies\n\nprocedures addressing information flow enforcement\n\nsecurity architecture documentation\n\nprivacy architecture documentation\n\nsystem design documentation\n\nsystem configuration settings and associated documentation\n\nsystem baseline configuration\n\nlist of information flow authorizations\n\nsystem audit records\n\nsystem security plan\n\nprivacy plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"ac-4_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-04-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"System\/network administrators\n\norganizational personnel with information security and privacy architecture development responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities\n\nsystem developers"}]},{"id":"ac-4_asm-test","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-04-Test","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ac-4.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Object Security and Privacy Attributes","params":[{"id":"ac-4.1_prm_1","label":"organization-defined security and privacy attributes"},{"id":"ac-4.1_prm_2","label":"organization-defined information, source, and destination objects"},{"id":"ac-04.01_odp.01","label":"security attributes","guidelines":[{"prose":"security attributes to be associated with information, source, and destination objects are defined;"}]},{"id":"ac-04.01_odp.02","label":"privacy attributes","guidelines":[{"prose":"privacy attributes to be associated with information, source, and destination objects are defined;"}]},{"id":"ac-04.01_odp.03","label":"information objects","guidelines":[{"prose":"information objects to be associated with information security attributes are defined;"}]},{"id":"ac-04.01_odp.04","label":"information objects","guidelines":[{"prose":"information objects to be associated with privacy attributes are defined;"}]},{"id":"ac-04.01_odp.05","label":"source objects","guidelines":[{"prose":"source objects to be associated with information security attributes are defined;"}]},{"id":"ac-04.01_odp.06","label":"source objects","guidelines":[{"prose":"source objects to be associated with privacy attributes are defined;"}]},{"id":"ac-04.01_odp.07","label":"destination objects","guidelines":[{"prose":"destination objects to be associated with information security attributes are defined;"}]},{"id":"ac-04.01_odp.08","label":"destination objects","guidelines":[{"prose":"destination objects to be associated with privacy attributes are defined;"}]},{"id":"ac-04.01_odp.09","label":"information flow control policies","guidelines":[{"prose":"information flow control policies as a basis for enforcement of flow control decisions are defined;"}]}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4(1)"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-04(01)","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-04.01"}],"links":[{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"required"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-4.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Use {{ insert: param, ac-4.1_prm_1 }} associated with {{ insert: param, ac-4.1_prm_2 }} to enforce {{ insert: param, ac-04.01_odp.09 }} as a basis for flow control decisions."},{"id":"ac-4.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security and privacy attributes associated with information (i.e., data content and structure) and source and destination objects and respond appropriately when the enforcement mechanisms encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies.

Separation of duties is enforced through the account management activities in [AC-2](#ac-2) , access control mechanisms in [AC-3](#ac-3) , and identity management activities in [IA-2](#ia-2), [IA-4](#ia-4) , and [IA-12](#ia-12)."},{"id":"ac-5_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-05","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-5_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-05a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":" {{ insert: param, ac-05_odp }} are identified and documented;"},{"id":"ac-5_obj.b","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-05b.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"system access authorizations to support separation of duties are defined."}]},{"id":"ac-5_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-05-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Access control policy\n\nprocedures addressing divisions of responsibility and separation of duties\n\nsystem configuration settings and associated documentation\n\nlist of divisions of responsibility and separation of duties\n\nsystem access authorizations\n\nsystem audit records\n\nsystem security plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"ac-5_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-05-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining appropriate divisions of responsibility and separation of duties\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\n\nsystem\/network administrators"}]},{"id":"ac-5_asm-test","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-05-Test","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Mechanisms implementing separation of duties policy"}]}]},{"id":"ac-6","class":"SP800-53","title":"Least Privilege","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-6"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-06","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-06"}],"links":[{"href":"#ac-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ac-16","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related"},{"href":"#cm-11","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pl-2","rel":"related"},{"href":"#pm-12","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-15","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sa-17","rel":"related"},{"href":"#sc-38","rel":"related"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-6_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks."},{"id":"ac-6_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and systems.

If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ different algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute force attacks.

Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures, such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions that represent the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. Privacy attributes, which may be used independently or in conjunction with security attributes, represent the basic properties or characteristics of active or passive entities with respect to the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes can be either explicitly or implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational systems or system components.\n\nAttributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information, cause information to flow among objects, or change the system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of attributes to subjects and objects by a system is referred to as binding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Attributes, when bound to data or information, permit the enforcement of security and privacy policies for access control and information flow control, including data retention limits, permitted uses of personally identifiable information, and identification of personal information within data objects. Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions or mechanisms. The binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength of attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques play important parts in the trust that organizations have in the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by organizations. The content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.\n\nOrganizations can define the types of attributes needed for systems to support missions or business functions. There are many values that can be assigned to a security attribute. By specifying the permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations ensure that attribute values are meaningful and relevant. Labeling refers to the association of attributes with the subjects and objects represented by the internal data structures within systems. This facilitates system-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Labels include classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements (e.g., top secret, secret, confidential, controlled unclassified), information impact level; high value asset information, access authorizations, nationality; data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration), personally identifiable information processing permissions, including individual consent to personally identifiable information processing, and contractor affiliation. A related term to labeling is marking. Marking refers to the association of attributes with objects in a human-readable form and displayed on system media. Marking enables manual, procedural, or process-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Security and privacy labels may have the same value as media markings (e.g., top secret, secret, confidential). See [MP-3](#mp-3) (Media Marking)."},{"id":"ac-16_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-16_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-16_obj.a.1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16a.[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"the

The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook\/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.\n\nDue to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.\n\nUsage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system.

implementation of required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and systems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).\n\nFor some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.\n\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope of [AC-20](#ac-20) . Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and conditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems."},{"id":"ac-20_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-20_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-20_obj.a.1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20a.1","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":" {{ insert: param, ac-20_odp.01 }} is\/are consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and\/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to access the system from external systems (if applicable);"},{"id":"ac-20_obj.a.2","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20a.2","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":" {{ insert: param, ac-20_odp.01 }} is\/are consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and\/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems (if applicable);"}]},{"id":"ac-20_obj.b","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20b.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"the use of {{ insert: param, ac-20_odp.04 }} is prohibited (if applicable)."}]},{"id":"ac-20_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Access control policy\n\nprocedures addressing the use of external systems\n\nexternal systems terms and conditions\n\nlist of types of applications accessible from external systems\n\nmaximum security categorization for information processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems\n\nsystem configuration settings and associated documentation\n\nsystem security plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"ac-20_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining terms and conditions for use of external systems to access organizational systems\n\nsystem\/network administrators\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities"}]},{"id":"ac-20_asm-test","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20-Test","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on the use of external systems"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ac-20.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Limits on Authorized Use","props":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(1)"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(01)","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-20.01"}],"links":[{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"required"},{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"related"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-20.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only after:","parts":[{"id":"ac-20.1_smt.a","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s security and privacy policies and security and privacy plans; or"},{"id":"ac-20.1_smt.b","name":"item","props":[{"name":"label","value":"(b)"}],"prose":"Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external system."}]},{"id":"ac-20.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances where individuals using external systems may need to access organizational systems.

Data mining protection focuses on protecting information from data mining while such information resides in organizational data stores.

The types of events that require logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the privacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or privacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action changes, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are operational and supported by the system.\n\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization. Organizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals that may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging event is based on patterns or time of usage.\n\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements. These include [AC-2(4)](#ac-2.4), [AC-3(10)](#ac-3.10), [AC-6(9)](#ac-6.9), [AC-17(1)](#ac-17.1), [CM-3f](#cm-3_smt.f), [CM-5(1)](#cm-5.1), [IA-3(3)(b)](#ia-3.3_smt.b), [MA-4(1)](#ma-4.1), [MP-4(2)](#mp-4.2), [PE-3](#pe-3), [PM-21](#pm-21), [PT-7](#pt-7), [RA-8](#ra-8), [SC-7(9)](#sc-7.9), [SC-7(15)](#sc-7.15), [SI-3(8)](#si-3.8), [SI-4(22)](#si-4.22), [SI-7(8)](#si-7.8) , and [SI-10(1)](#si-10.1) . Organizations include event types that are required by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented

Rather, integrated analysis requires that the analysis of information generated by scanning, monitoring, or other data collection activities is integrated with the analysis of audit record information. Security Information and Event Management tools can facilitate audit record aggregation or consolidation from multiple system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans of the system and in correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can uncover denial-of-service attacks or other types of attacks that result in the unauthorized use of resources.

The required skills include general knowledge of risk management concepts and approaches as well as comprehensive knowledge of and experience with the hardware, software, and firmware system components implemented.\n\nOrganizations assess controls in systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of initial and ongoing authorizations, continuous monitoring, FISMA annual assessments, system design and development, systems security engineering, privacy engineering, and the system development life cycle. Assessments help to ensure that organizations meet information security and privacy requirements, identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the system design and development process, provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of authorization processes, and comply with vulnerability mitigation procedures. Organizations conduct assessments on the implemented controls as documented in security and privacy plans. Assessments can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of systems engineering and systems security engineering processes. The design for controls can be assessed as RFPs are developed, responses assessed, and design reviews conducted. If a design to implement controls and subsequent implementation in accordance with the design are assessed during development, the final control testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing previously completed control assessment and aggregating the outcomes.\n\nOrganizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment plan for the system or maintain separate plans. A consolidated assessment plan clearly delineates the roles and responsibilities for control assessment. If multiple organizations participate in assessing a system, a coordinated approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs.\n\nOrganizations can use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring, to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during the system life cycle. Assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail, as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting requirements. Assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials, senior agency officials for privacy, senior agency information security officers, and authorizing official designated representatives.\n\nTo satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations, continuous monitoring, systems engineering processes, or system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. After the initial authorizations, organizations assess controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations also establish the frequency for ongoing assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies.

conduct impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality means that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation, sustainment, or management of the systems under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services.\n\nIndependent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of systems and\/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. Assessor independence determination includes whether contracted assessment services have sufficient independence, such as when system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of the assessors conducting the assessments. During the system design and development phase, having independent assessors is analogous to having independent SMEs involved in design reviews.\n\nWhen organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the organizations require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of the system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results. Assessments performed for purposes other than to support authorization decisions are more likely to be useable for such decisions when performed by assessors with sufficient independence, thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments."},{"id":"ca-2.1_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(01)","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"independent assessors or assessment teams are employed to conduct control assessments."},{"id":"ca-2.1_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(01)-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy\n\nprocedures addressing control assessments\n\nprevious control assessment plan\n\nprevious control assessment report\n\nplan of action and milestones\n\nexisting authorization statement\n\nsystem security plan\n\nprivacy plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"ca-2.1_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(01)-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with security assessment responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities"}]}]},{"id":"ca-2.2","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Specialized Assessments","params":[{"id":"ca-02.02_odp.01","label":"specialized assessment frequency","guidelines":[{"prose":"frequency at which to include specialized assessments as part of the control assessment is defined;"}]},{"id":"ca-02.02_odp.02","select":{"choice":["announced","unannounced"]}},{"id":"ca-02.02_odp.03","select":{"how-many":"one-or-more","choice":["in-depth monitoring","security instrumentation","automated security test cases","vulnerability scanning","malicious user testing","insider threat assessment","performance and load testing","data leakage or data loss assessment"," {{ insert: param, ca-02.02_odp.04 }} "]}},{"id":"ca-02.02_odp.04","label":"other forms of assessment","guidelines":[{"prose":"other forms of assessment are defined (if selected);"}]}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-2(2)"},{"name":"label","value":"CA-02(02)","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ca-02.02"}],"links":[{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"required"},{"href":"#pe-3","rel":"related"},{"href":"#si-2","rel":"related"}],"parts":[{"id":"ca-2.2_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Include as part of control assessments, {{ insert: param, ca-02.02_odp.01 }}, {{ insert: param, ca-02.02_odp.02 }}, {{ insert: param, ca-02.02_odp.03 }}."},{"id":"ca-2.2_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Organizations can conduct specialized assessments, including verification and validation, system monitoring, insider threat assessments, malicious user testing, and other forms of testing.

Organizations consider the risk related to new or increased threats that may be introduced when systems exchange information with other systems that may have different security and privacy requirements and controls. This includes systems within the same organization and systems that are external to the organization.

The types of agreements selected are based on factors such as the impact level of the information being exchanged, the relationship between the organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government to business, business to business, government or business to service provider, government or business to individual), or the level of access to the organizational system by users of the other system. If systems that exchange information have the same authorizing official, organizations need not develop agreements.

The authorization process is a federal responsibility, and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Authorizing officials are both responsible and accountable for security and privacy risks associated with the operation and use of organizational systems. Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes to authorize systems and senior officials that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities.\n\nAuthorizing officials issue ongoing authorizations of systems based on evidence produced from implemented continuous monitoring programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs reduce the need for separate reauthorization processes. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, the information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security and privacy plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis. This provides authorizing officials, common control providers, and system owners with an up-to-date status of the security and privacy posture of their systems, controls, and operating environments.

The terms \"continuous\" and \"ongoing\" imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring generate risk response actions by organizations. When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple controls that have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause analysis may be needed to determine the specific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security and privacy information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the ability to make effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization decisions.\n\nAutomation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and firmware inventories, authorization packages, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security categories of systems.

conducted on systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating system, and\/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols).\n\nOrganizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware, software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes a pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the system, pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest analysis, and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement before commencing penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries.

Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission\/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.

Parameters that impact the security posture of systems include registry settings; account, file, or directory permission settings; and settings for functions, protocols, ports, services, and remote connections. Privacy parameters are parameters impacting the privacy posture of systems, including the parameters required to satisfy other privacy controls. Privacy parameters include settings for access controls, data processing preferences, and processing and retention permissions. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become part of the configuration baseline for the system.\n\nCommon secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, and security reference guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for information technology products and platforms as well as instructions for configuring those products or platforms to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations, including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, federal agencies, consortia, academia, industry, and other organizations in the public and private sectors.\n\nImplementation of a common secure configuration may be mandated at the organization level, mission and business process level, system level, or at a higher level, including by a regulatory agency. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline [USGCB](#98498928-3ca3-44b3-8b1e-f48685373087) and security technical implementation guides (STIGs), which affect the implementation of [CM-6](#cm-6) and other controls such as [AC-19](#ac-19) and [CM-7](#cm-7) .

Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services.

Organizations may choose to implement centralized system component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the inventories include system-specific information required for component accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes the system name, software owners, software version numbers, hardware inventory specifications, software license information, and for networked components, the machine names and network addresses across all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications include date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, supplier information, component type, and physical location.\n\nPreventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of accountability that occurs when component ownership and system association is not known, especially in large or complex connected systems. Effective prevention of duplicate accounting of system components necessitates use of a unique identifier for each component. For software inventory, centrally managed software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a component of the system on which it is installed and managed. Software installed on multiple organizational systems and managed at the system level is addressed for each individual system and may appear more than once in a centralized component inventory, necessitating a system association for each software instance in the centralized inventory to avoid duplicate accounting of components. Scanning systems implementing multiple network protocols (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6) can result in duplicate components being identified in different address spaces.

Configuration management plans define processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities.\n\nConfiguration management plans are generated during the development and acquisition stage of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to advance changes through change management processes; update configuration settings and baselines; maintain component inventories; control development, test, and operational environments; and develop, release, and update key documents.\n\nOrganizations can employ templates to help ensure the consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Templates can represent a configuration management plan for the organization with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include the designation of key stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to systems, and personnel who conduct security and privacy impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems.

organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.\n\nActions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in [IR-4(5)](#ir-4.5) . Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in the [IR](#ir) (Incident Response)

Organizational users include employees or individuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g., contractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to all accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in [AC-14](#ac-14) and that occur through the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\n\nOrganizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user identities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is obtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks.\n\nThe use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network.

New authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity and the authenticator to be implemented external to a system. For example, with smartcard credentials, the identity and authenticator are bound together on the smartcard. Using these credentials, systems can authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication.

Suspected security incidents include the receipt of suspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain incidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational systems or system components. For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally identifiable information is considered a breach. A breach results in unauthorized disclosure, the loss of control, unauthorized acquisition, compromise, or a similar occurrence where a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information or an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses such information for other than authorized purposes."},{"id":"ir-4_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-04","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ir-4_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-04a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ir-4_obj.a.1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-04a.[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"an

The incident handling capability includes performing rapid forensic preservation of evidence and analysis of and response to intrusions. For some organizations, the incident response team can be a cross-organizational entity.\n\nAn integrated incident response team facilitates information sharing and allows organizational personnel (e.g., developers, implementers, and operators) to leverage team knowledge of the threat and implement defensive measures that enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, integrated teams promote the rapid detection of intrusions, the development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing cyber intelligence development. Integrated incident response teams are better able to identify adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures that are linked to the operations tempo or specific mission and business functions and to define responsive actions in a way that does not disrupt those mission and business functions.

The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.

the media is considered removable. Examples include digital media in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, mobile devices, and non-digital media (e.g., paper and microfilm). The sanitization process removes information from system media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques—including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, de-identification of personally identifiable information, and destruction—prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media that contains information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable or information deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes destruction, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media that contains classified information.

Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to physical and environmental protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

overview of the security and privacy requirements for the system and the controls selected to satisfy the requirements. The plans describe the intended application of each selected control in the context of the system with a sufficient level of detail to correctly implement the control and to subsequently assess the effectiveness of the control. The control documentation describes how system-specific and hybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of the system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development of systems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy engineering processes. System security and privacy plans are living documents that are updated and adapted throughout the system development life cycle (e.g., during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for proposal, and design reviews). [Section 2.1](#c3397cc9-83c6-4459-adb2-836739dc1b94) describes the different types of requirements that are relevant to organizations during the system development life cycle and the relationship between requirements and controls.\n\nOrganizations may develop a single, integrated security and privacy plan or maintain separate plans. Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to a set of controls and control enhancements. The plans describe how the controls and control enhancements meet the security and privacy requirements but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls and control enhancements. Security and privacy plans contain sufficient information (including specifications of control parameter values for selection and assignment operations explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented.\n\nSecurity and privacy plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a collection of various documents, including documents that already exist. Effective security and privacy plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents, including design and implementation specifications where more detailed information can be obtained. The use of references helps reduce the documentation associated with security and privacy programs and maintains the security- and privacy-related information in other established management and operational areas, including enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. Security and privacy plans need not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but can instead provide—explicitly or by reference—sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.\n\nSecurity- and privacy-related activities that may require coordination and planning with other individuals or groups within the organization include assessments, audits, inspections, hardware and software maintenance, acquisition and supply chain risk management, patch management, and contingency plan testing. Planning and coordination include emergency and nonemergency (i.e., planned or non-urgent unplanned) situations. The process defined by organizations to plan and coordinate security- and privacy-related activities can also be included in other documents, as appropriate."},{"id":"pl-2_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-02","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"pl-2_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-02a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"pl-2_obj.a.1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-02a.01","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"pl-2_obj.a.1.1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-02a.01[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"a

The architectures include an architectural description, the allocation of security and privacy functionality (including controls), security- and privacy-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. The architectures can also include other information, such as user roles and the access privileges assigned to each role; security and privacy requirements; types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system; supply chain risk management requirements; restoration priorities of information and system services; and other protection needs.\n\n [SP 800-160-1](#e3cc0520-a366-4fc9-abc2-5272db7e3564) provides guidance on the use of security architectures as part of the system development life cycle process. [OMB M-19-03](#c5e11048-1d38-4af3-b00b-0d88dc26860c) requires the use of the systems security engineering concepts described in [SP 800-160-1](#e3cc0520-a366-4fc9-abc2-5272db7e3564) for high value assets. Security and privacy architectures are reviewed and updated throughout the system development life cycle, from analysis of alternatives through review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses to the design reviews before and during implementation (e.g., during preliminary design reviews and critical design reviews).\n\nIn today’s modern computing architectures, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy architectures is necessary for developing a comprehensive mission and business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control a baseline configuration for organizational systems is critical to implementing and maintaining effective architectures. The development of the architectures is coordinated with the senior agency information security officer and the senior agency official for privacy to ensure that the controls needed to support security and privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. In many circumstances, there may be no distinction between the security and privacy architecture for a system. In other circumstances, security objectives may be adequately satisfied, but privacy objectives may only be partially satisfied by the security requirements. In these cases, consideration of the privacy requirements needed to achieve satisfaction will result in a distinct privacy architecture. The documentation, however, may simply reflect the combined architectures.\n\n [PL-8](#pl-8) is primarily directed at organizations to ensure that architectures are developed for the system and, moreover, that the architectures are integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. In contrast, [SA-17](#sa-17) is primarily directed at the external information technology product and system developers and integrators. [SA-17](#sa-17) , which is complementary to [PL-8](#pl-8) , is selected when organizations outsource the development of systems or components to external entities and when there is a need to demonstrate consistency with the organization’s enterprise architecture and security and privacy

This includes planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed controls and processes. As the central management of controls is generally associated with the concept of common (inherited) controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of control implementations and management and the judicious use of organizational resources. Centrally managed controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate and as part of organizational continuous monitoring.\n\nAutomated tools (e.g., security information and event management tools or enterprise security monitoring and management tools) can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of information associated with centrally managed controls and processes. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities; alerting mechanisms; and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization.\n\nAs part of the control selection processes, organizations determine the controls that may be suitable for central management based on resources and capabilities. It is not always possible to centrally manage every aspect of a control. In such cases, the control can be treated as a hybrid control with the control managed and implemented centrally or at the system level.

Privacy program plans and supply chain risk management plans are addressed separately in [PM-18](#pm-18) and [SR-2](#sr-2) , respectively.\n\nAn information security program plan documents implementation details about program management and common controls. The plan provides sufficient information about the controls (including specification of parameters for assignment and selection operations, explicitly or by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plan and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plan is implemented as intended. Updates to information security program plans include organizational changes and problems identified during plan implementation or control assessments.\n\nProgram management controls may be implemented at the organization level or the mission or business process level, and are essential for managing the organization’s information security program. Program management controls are distinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid controls because program management controls are independent of any particular system. Together, the individual system security plans and the organization-wide information security program plan provide complete coverage for the security controls employed within the organization.\n\nCommon controls available for inheritance by organizational systems are documented in an appendix to the organization’s information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for a system. The organization-wide information security program plan indicates which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.\n\nEvents that may precipitate an update to the information

The same standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified and other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and nontechnical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations to prepare department or agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness training to employees, receive access to information from offices in the department or agency for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department or agency insider threat posture.\n\nInsider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace, including ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues. These precursors can guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. However, the use of human resource records could raise significant concerns for privacy.

privacy posture across the organization to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms \"continuous\" and \"ongoing\" imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring guide and inform risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security- and privacy-related information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make effective, timely, and informed risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization decisions. To further facilitate security and privacy risk management, organizations consider aligning organization-defined monitoring metrics with organizational risk tolerance as defined in the risk management strategy.

The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of the position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse effect on national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the sensitivity level of a position.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities—such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors), networked printers, scanners, and copiers—are not overlooked. The capability to readily update vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced and as new scanning methods are developed helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by employed vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers.\n\nVulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning. Vulnerability monitoring tools that facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).\n\nVulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including notification authorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations generally expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization for remediation.\n\nOrganizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as \"bug bounties\" ) to further encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs can be tailored to the organization’s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely or over a defined period of time and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group. Organizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously and could choose to offer partially credentialed access to certain participants in order to evaluate security vulnerabilities from privileged vantage points."},{"id":"ra-5_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"RA-05","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ra-5_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"RA-05a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"ra-5_obj.a.1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"RA-05a.[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"systems

In order to conduct a meaningful privacy impact assessment, the organization’s senior agency official for privacy works closely with program managers, system owners, information technology experts, security officials, counsel, and other relevant organization personnel. Moreover, a privacy impact assessment is not a time-restricted activity that is limited to a particular milestone or stage of the information system or personally identifiable information life cycles.

For example, criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives, policies, standards, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and external to the system.\n\nThe operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality, including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of-systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities that such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported by the system that contains the components and functions.\n\nCriticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If such analysis is performed early in the system development life cycle, organizations may be able to modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and functions, such as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. Criticality analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development contractors. In addition to criticality analysis for systems, system components, and system services, criticality analysis of information is an important consideration.

The integration of security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle is a foundational principle of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical mission and business functions. The security engineering principles in [SA-8](#sa-8) help individuals properly design, code, and test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy architects, and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.\n\nThe effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout the system life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational mission and business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security and privacy architectures into the enterprise architecture, consistent with the risk management strategy of the organization. Because the system development life cycle involves multiple organizations, (e.g., external suppliers, developers, integrators, service providers), acquisition and supply chain risk management functions and controls play significant roles in the effective management of the system during the life

and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-level security and privacy requirements described in [SA-2](#sa-2) . The derived requirements include security and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements include development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from development and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required functionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. [SP 800-160-1](#e3cc0520-a366-4fc9-abc2-5272db7e3564) describes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.\n\nControls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting the security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in order to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities. Controls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection and implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in the form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived requirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of implementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.\n\nSecurity and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development life cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and operation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security categorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend on the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements can include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in the same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or

Examples of system security engineering principles include: developing layered protections; establishing security and privacy policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development; incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build secure software; tailoring controls to meet organizational needs; and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk.\n\nOrganizations that apply systems security and privacy engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk management decisions.

Minimized sharing helps to simplify system design and implementation. In order to protect user-domain resources from arbitrary active entities, no resource is shared unless that sharing has been explicitly requested and granted. The need for resource sharing can be motivated by the design principle of least common mechanism in the case of internal entities or driven by stakeholder requirements. However, internal sharing is carefully designed to avoid performance and covert storage and timing channel problems. Sharing via common mechanism can increase the susceptibility of data and information to unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or modification and can adversely affect the inherent capability provided by the system.

To analyze a system composed of heterogeneously trustworthy components for its trustworthiness, it is essential to eliminate circular dependencies with regard to the trustworthiness.

For example, the root certificate of a certificate hierarchy is the most trusted node in the hierarchy, whereas the leaves in the hierarchy may be the least trustworthy nodes. Another example occurs in a layered high-assurance system where the security kernel (including the hardware base), which is located at the lowest layer of the system, is the most trustworthy component.

Applying the principle of least privilege limits the scope of the component’s actions, which has two desirable effects: the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the component will have a minimized security impact, and the security analysis of the component will be simplified. Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in all aspects of the secure system design. Interfaces used to invoke component capability are available to only certain subsets of the user population, and component design supports a sufficiently fine granularity of privilege decomposition. For example, in the case of an audit mechanism, there may be an interface for the audit manager, who configures the audit settings; an interface for the audit operator, who ensures that audit data is safely collected and stored; and, finally, yet another interface for the audit reviewer, who only has need to view the audit data that has been collected but no need to perform operations on that data.\n\nIn addition to its manifestations at the system interface, least privilege can be used as a guiding principle for the internal structure of the system itself.

The continuous protection principle requires that changes to the system security policies be traceable to the operational need that drives the configuration and be verifiable (i.e., it is possible to verify that the proposed changes will not put the system into an insecure state). Insufficient traceability and verification may lead to inconsistent states or protection discontinuities due to the complex or undecidable nature of the problem. The use of pre-verified configuration definitions that reflect the new security policy enables analysis to determine that a transition from old to new policies is essentially atomic and that any residual effects from the old policy are guaranteed to not conflict with the new policy.

Data is generally not interpreted by the system that stores it. It may have semantic value (i.e., it comprises information) to users and programs that process the data. In contrast, metadata is information about data, such as a file name or the date when the file was created. Metadata is bound to the target data that it describes in a way that the system can interpret, but it need not be stored inside of or proximate to its target data.

It follows that all subjects and objects in the scope of control of the MLS system are either directly labeled or indirectly attributed with sensitivity levels.

At the system level, self-analysis can be achieved through hierarchical assessments of trustworthiness established in a bottom-up fashion. In this approach, the lower-level components check for data integrity and correct functionality (to a limited extent) of higher-level components. For example, trusted boot sequences involve a trusted lower-level component that attests to the trustworthiness of the next higher-level components so that a transitive chain of trust can be established. At the root, a component attests to itself, which usually involves an axiomatic or environmentally enforced assumption about its integrity.

The principle of secure failure and recovery parallels the principle of continuous protection to ensure that a system is capable of detecting (within limits) actual and impending failure at any stage of its operation (i.e., initialization, normal operation, shutdown, and maintenance) and to take appropriate steps to ensure that security policies are not violated. In addition, when specified, the system is capable of recovering from impending or actual failure to resume normal, degraded, or alternative secure operations while ensuring that a secure state is maintained such that security policies are not violated.\n\nFailure is a condition in which the behavior of a component deviates from its specified or expected behavior for an explicitly documented input. Once a failed security function is detected, the system may reconfigure itself to circumvent the failed component while maintaining security and provide all or part of the functionality of the original system, or it may completely shut itself down to prevent any further violation of security policies. For this to occur, the reconfiguration functions of the system are designed to ensure continuous enforcement of security policy during the various phases of reconfiguration.\n\nAnother technique that can be used to recover from failures is to perform a rollback to a secure state (which may be the initial state) and then either shutdown or replace the service or component that failed such that secure operations may resume. Failure of a component may or may not be detectable to the components using it. The principle of secure failure indicates that components fail in a state that denies rather than grants access. For example, a nominally \"atomic\" operation interrupted before completion does not violate security policy and is designed to handle interruption events by employing higher-level atomicity and rollback mechanisms (e.g., transactions). If a service is being used, its atomicity properties are well-documented and characterized so that the component availing itself of that service can detect and handle interruption events appropriately. For example, a system is designed to gracefully respond to disconnection and support resynchronization and data consistency after disconnection.\n\nFailure protection strategies that employ replication of policy enforcement mechanisms, sometimes called defense in depth, can allow the system to continue in a secure state even when one mechanism has failed to protect the system. If the mechanisms are similar, however, the additional protection may be illusory, as the adversary can simply attack in series. Similarly, in a networked system, breaking the security on one system or service may enable an attacker to do the same on other similar replicated systems and services. By employing multiple protection mechanisms whose features are significantly different, the possibility of attack replication or repetition can be reduced. Analyses are conducted to weigh the costs and benefits of such redundancy techniques against increased resource usage and adverse effects on the overall system performance. Additional analyses are conducted as the complexity of these mechanisms increases, as could be the case for dynamic behaviors. Increased complexity generally reduces trustworthiness. When a resource cannot be continuously protected, it is critical to detect and repair any security breaches before the resource is once again used in a secure context."},{"id":"sa-8.24_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-08(24)","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-8.24_obj.1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-08(24)[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":" {{ insert: param, sa-08.24_odp.01 }} implement the security design principle of secure failure;"},{"id":"sa-8.24_obj.2","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-08(24)[02]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":" {{ insert: param, sa-08.24_odp.02 }} implement the security design principle of secure recovery."}]},{"id":"sa-8.24_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"SA-08(24)-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"System and services acquisition policy\n\nsystem and communications protection policy\n\ncontingency planning policy\n\nprocedures addressing information system recovery and reconstitution\n\nprocedures addressing the security design principle of secure failure and recovery used in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system\n\ncontingency plan\n\nprocedures addressing system backup\n\ncontingency plan test documentation\n\ncontingency plan test results\n\nsystem design documentation\n\nsecurity and privacy requirements and specifications for the system\n\nsystem security and privacy architecture\n\nsystem security plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"sa-8.24_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"SA-08(24)-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with the responsibility for determining system security and privacy requirements\n\norganizational personnel with system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with contingency plan testing responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with system recovery and reconstitution responsibilities\n\nsystem developers\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with information system backup responsibilities"}]},{"id":"sa-8.24_asm-test","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"SA-08(24)-Test","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational processes for applying the security design principle of secure failure and recovery in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification\n\nmechanisms supporting the application of the security design principle of secure failure and recovery in system specification, design, development, implementation, and modification\n\nmechanisms supporting and\/or implementing secure failure\n\norganizational processes for contingency plan testing\n\nmechanisms supporting contingency plan testing\n\nmechanisms supporting recovery and reconstitution of the system\n\norganizational processes for conducting system backups\n\nmechanisms supporting and\/or implementing system backups"}]}]},{"id":"sa-8.25","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Economic Security","params":[{"id":"sa-08.25_odp","label":"systems or system components","guidelines":[{"prose":"systems or system components that implement the security design principle of economic security are defined;"}]}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-8(25)"},{"name":"label","value":"SA-08(25)","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sa-08.25"}],"links":[{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"required"},{"href":"#ra-3","rel":"related"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-8.25_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Implement the security design principle of economic security in {{ insert: param, sa-08.25_odp }}."},{"id":"sa-8.25_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"The principle of economic security states that security mechanisms are not costlier than the potential damage that could occur from a security breach.

For the system implementation to meet its design requirements and be found acceptable to stakeholders (i.e., validation against stakeholder requirements), the designers adhere to the specified constraints that capability performance needs place on protection needs. The overall impact of computationally intensive security services (e.g., cryptography) are assessed and demonstrated to pose no significant impact to higher-priority performance considerations or are deemed to provide an acceptable trade-off of performance for trustworthy protection. The trade-off considerations include less computationally intensive security services unless they are unavailable or insufficient. The insufficiency of a security service is determined by functional capability and strength of mechanism. The strength of mechanism is selected with respect to security requirements, performance-critical overhead issues (e.g., cryptographic key management), and an assessment of the capability of the threat.\n\nThe principle of performance security leads to the incorporation of features that help in the enforcement of security policy but incur minimum overhead, such as low-level hardware mechanisms upon which higher-level services can be built. Such low-level mechanisms are usually very specific, have very limited functionality, and are optimized for performance. For example, once access rights to a portion of memory is granted, many systems use hardware mechanisms to ensure that all further accesses involve the correct memory address and access mode.

The principle of reduced complexity applies to any aspect of a system, but it has particular importance for security due to the various analyses performed to obtain evidence about the emergent security property of the system. For such analyses to be successful, a small and simple design is essential. Application of the principle of reduced complexity contributes to the ability of system developers to understand the correctness and completeness of system security functions and facilitates the identification of potential vulnerabilities. The corollary of reduced complexity states that the simplicity of the system is directly related to the number of vulnerabilities it will contain. That is, simpler systems contain fewer vulnerabilities. An important benefit of reduced complexity is that it is easier to understand whether the security policy has been captured in the system design and that fewer vulnerabilities are likely to be introduced during engineering development.

Applying the principle of least privilege limits the scope of the component’s actions, which has two desirable effects. First, the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the system component results in a minimized security impact. Second, the security analysis of the component is simplified. Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in all aspects of the secure system design. Interfaces used to invoke component capability are available to only certain subsets of the user population, and component design supports a sufficiently fine granularity of privilege decomposition. For example, in the case of an audit mechanism, there may be an interface for the audit manager, who configures the audit settings; an interface for the audit operator, who ensures that audit data is safely collected and stored; and, finally, yet another interface for the audit reviewer, who only has a need to view the audit data that has been collected but no need to perform operations on that data.\n\nIn addition to its manifestations at the system interface, least privilege can be used as a guiding principle for the internal structure of the system itself. One aspect of internal least privilege is to construct modules so that only the elements encapsulated by the module are directly operated upon by the functions within the module. Elements external to a module that may be affected by the module’s operation are indirectly accessed through interaction (e.g., via a function call) with the module that contains those elements. Another aspect of internal least privilege is that the scope of a given module or component includes only those system elements that are necessary for its functionality, and the access modes to the elements (e.g., read, write) are minimal."},{"id":"sa-17.7_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-17(07)","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to structure security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to facilitate controlling access with least privilege."},{"id":"sa-17.7_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"SA-17(07)-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"System and services acquisition policy\n\nenterprise architecture policy\n\nprocedures addressing developer security architecture and design specifications for the system\n\nsolicitation documentation\n\nacquisition documentation\n\nservice level agreements\n\nacquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service\n\nsystem design documentation\n\nsystem security architecture documentation\n\nsystem configuration settings and associated documentation\n\ndeveloper documentation describing the design and structure of security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware components to facilitate controlling access with least privilege\n\nsystem security plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"sa-17.7_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"SA-17(07)-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\n\nsystem developer\n\norganizational personnel with information security architecture and design responsibilities"}]}]},{"id":"sa-17.8","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Orchestration","params":[{"id":"sa-17.08_odp.01","label":"critical systems","guidelines":[{"prose":"critical systems or system components are defined;"}]},{"id":"sa-17.08_odp.02","label":"capabilities","guidelines":[{"prose":"capabilities to be implemented by systems or components are defined;"}]}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-17(8)"},{"name":"label","value":"SA-17(08)","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sa-17.08"}],"links":[{"href":"#sa-17","rel":"required"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-17.8_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Design {{ insert: param, sa-17.08_odp.01 }} with coordinated behavior to implement the following capabilities: {{ insert: param, sa-17.08_odp.02 }}."},{"id":"sa-17.8_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Security resources that are distributed, located at different layers or in different system elements, or are implemented to support different aspects of trustworthiness can interact in unforeseen or incorrect ways.

The isolation boundary controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform system security functions. Systems implement code separation in many ways, such as through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code.

Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine that the testing of software or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, such as when implementing simple malicious code signature updates.

Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats contained within compressed or hidden files or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways, including by electronic mail, the world-wide web, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code.\n\nMalicious code protection mechanisms include both signature- and nonsignature-based technologies. Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software as well as custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.\n\nIn situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations rely on other types of controls, including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that, in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, the detection of malicious downloads, or the detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute

External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations monitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives guide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved through a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and network monitoring software.\n\nDepending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices may impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations across a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput management is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an established organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical applications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls [SC-7](#sc-7) and [AC-17](#ac-17) . The information collected is a function of the organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those programs. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., [AC-2g](#ac-2_smt.g), [AC-2(7)](#ac-2.7), [AC-2(12)(a)](#ac-2.12_smt.a), [AC-17(1)](#ac-17.1), [AU-13](#au-13), [AU-13(1)](#au-13.1), [AU-13(2)](#au-13.2), [CM-3f](#cm-3_smt.f), [CM-6d](#cm-6_smt.d), [MA-3a](#ma-3_smt.a), [MA-4a](#ma-4_smt.a), [SC-5(3)(b)](#sc-5.3_smt.b), [SC-7a](#sc-7_smt.a), [SC-7(24)(b)](#sc-7.24_smt.b), [SC-18b](#sc-18_smt.b), [SC-43b](#sc-43_smt.b) ).

Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

By implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components, organizations can provide a trusted, known state computing resource for a specific time period that does not give adversaries sufficient time to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems or operating environments. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat with regard to capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period, a percentage of attacks will be successful. Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required using protected information and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries attempting to compromise or breach organizational systems.\n\nNon-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, periodically reimaging components, or using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can be implemented by using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent). The benefit of periodic refreshes of system components and services is that it does not require organizations to first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but not with such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities."},{"id":"si-14_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-14_obj.1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"non-persistent

subject. Many datasets contain information about individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records. Datasets may also contain other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. Personally identifiable information is removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is not (or no longer) necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data. For example, if the dataset is only used to produce aggregate statistics, the identifiers that are not needed for producing those statistics are removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy protection since information that is removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly used.

If the organization receives email at one of the false email addresses, it knows that the database has been compromised.

providers, present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance against plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy implementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or incorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development\/sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\n\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is fit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans help organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk management plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating the plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and associated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address requirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system components and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented as part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see [SA-8](#sa-8))."},{"id":"sr-2_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-02","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"sr-2_obj.a","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-02a.","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"id":"sr-2_obj.a.1","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-02a.[01]","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":"a

Supply chain OPSEC may require organizations to withhold mission or business information from suppliers and may include the use of intermediaries to hide the end use or users of systems, system components, or system services."},{"id":"sr-7_obj","name":"assessment-objective","props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-07","class":"sp800-53a"}],"prose":" {{ insert: param, sr-07_odp }} are employed to protect supply chain-related information for the system, system component, or system service."},{"id":"sr-7_asm-examine","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"EXAMINE"},{"name":"label","value":"SR-07-Examine","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Supply chain risk management plan\n\nsupply chain risk management procedures\n\nsystem and services acquisition policy\n\nsystem and services acquisition procedures\n\nprocedures addressing supply chain protection\n\nlist of OPSEC controls to be employed\n\nsolicitation documentation\n\nacquisition documentation\n\nacquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service\n\nrecords of all-source intelligence analyses\n\nsystem security plan\n\nprivacy plan\n\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"id":"sr-7_asm-interview","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"INTERVIEW"},{"name":"label","value":"SR-07-Interview","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with acquisition responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with OPSEC responsibilities\n\norganizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities"}]},{"id":"sr-7_asm-test","name":"assessment-method","props":[{"name":"method","ns":"http:\/\/csrc.nist.gov\/ns\/rmf","value":"TEST"},{"name":"label","value":"SR-07-Test","class":"sp800-53a"}],"parts":[{"name":"assessment-objects","prose":"Organizational processes for defining and employing OPSEC safeguards\n\nmechanisms supporting and\/or implementing the definition and employment of OPSEC safeguards"}]}]},{"id":"sr-8","class":"SP800-53","title":"Notification Agreements","params":[{"id":"sr-08_odp.01","select":{"how-many":"one-or-more","choice":["notification of supply chain compromises"," {{ insert: param, sr-08_odp.02 }} "]}},{"id":"sr-08_odp.02","label":"results of assessments or audits","guidelines":[{"prose":"information for which agreements and procedures are to be established are defined (if selected);"}]}],"props":[{"name":"label","value":"SR-8"},{"name":"label","value":"SR-08","class":"sp800-53a"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sr-08"}],"links":[{"href":"#4ff10ed3-d8fe-4246-99e3-443045e27482","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#0f963c17-ab5a-432a-a867-91eac550309b","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#21caa535-1154-4369-ba7b-32c309fee0f7","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#863caf2a-978a-4260-9e8d-4a8929bce40c","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#08b07465-dbdc-48d6-8a0b-37279602ac16","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#e8e84963-14fc-4c3a-be05-b412a5d37cd2","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#e24b06cc-9129-4998-a76a-65c3d7a576ba","rel":"reference"},{"href":"#ir-4","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ir-6","rel":"related"},{"href":"#ir-8","rel":"related"}],"parts":[{"id":"sr-8_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Establish agreements and procedures with entities involved in the supply chain for the system, system component, or system service for the {{ insert: param, sr-08_odp.01 }}."},{"id":"sr-8_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"The establishment of agreements and procedures facilitates communications among supply chain entities.
